# CodeAlpha_Landing_Page
 This is a code snippet for creating a centered container on a landing page. The code is intended to be used in an HTML file on GitHub. The container is styled using CSS to have a maximum width of 800 pixels, with a margin of 0 auto to center it horizontally. It also has padding, a centered text alignment, a white background color, and a background image specified by the URL '8.jpg'. The background image is set to cover the container and is positioned in the center.  To achieve the centering effect, additional CSS properties are applied to the .container class. The container is positioned absolutely within its containing element and is vertically and horizontally centered using the top: 50%, left: 50%, and transform: translate(-50%, -50%) properties.  This code snippet can be useful for creating visually appealing landing pages on GitHub. Users can modify the background image, container dimensions, and other CSS properties as per their specific design requirements. The code can be easily added to an existing HTML file or integrated into a larger project on GitHub.
